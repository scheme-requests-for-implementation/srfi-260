<p>??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history.
The editor will add this section.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This SRFI defines the procedure <code>generate-symbol</code>. Each
time it is invoked, the procedure returns a new symbol whose name
cannot be guessed. The returned symbol is a standard symbol for all
purposes; it obeys write/read invariance and it is equal to another
symbol if and only if their names are spelt the same.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>A <dfn>unique object</dfn> is a Scheme value that is not equal
(usually with respect to <code>eqv?</code>) to existing (or potentially
existing) objects. Unique objects have many use cases, for example as
private keys in data structures or to uniquely mark other values.</p>

<p>Scheme has many ways to create such unique objects.  For many
purposes, an expression like <code>(string #\m)</code> can be used to
create a unique object. To improve type safety, alternatively, a
constructor of a record type with at least one mutable field can be
invoked.</p>

<p>There are circumstances where such unique objects, may they be
strings or records, cannot be used because an object of a particular
type, specifically a symbol, is needed. In the case of Scheme, this
applies to its syntax system. An identifier is a syntax object that is
a wrapped symbol
(see <a href="https://www.r6rs.org/">R<sup>6</sup>RS</a>).  To
generate unique identifiers with a given wrap, unique symbols (and not
strings, records, etc.), therefore, have to be generated.</p>

<p>The procedure <code>generate-symbol</code> defined in this SRFI
provides a means to generate unique symbols.</p>

<p>Alternative proposals
like <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-258/srfi-258.html">SRFI
258</a> provide so-called uninterned symbols that can also be used for
this purpose (at least after amending the definition of a syntax
object). Introducing uninterned symbols into the standard, however,
would weaken the semantics of symbols. Two symbols would no longer be
identical (in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>) if and only if their
names are spelt the same way.</p>

<p>Uninterned symbols have another disadvantage in that they defeat
write/read invariance. Yet, some kind of write/read invariance is
likely needed when uninterned symbols are used in identifier names so
that expanded Scheme code can be serialised (e.g. for separate AOT
expansion/compilation).</p>

<p>As names for generated symbols can be generated lazily, the alleged
advantage of uninterned symbols — that no names have to be generated — is
a bogus one. A name for a generated symbol only has to be generated
for use cases that need the unique name
from <code><span class="nobr">symbol-&gt;string</span></code>, e.g. for write/read purposes, but
these use cases are not covered by uninterned symbols anyway.</p>

<p>Generated symbols need no new lexical syntax.  The notion of a
Scheme datum value does not change; a Scheme datum value remains a
Scheme value that obeys write/read equivalence (up
to <code>equal?</code>).</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<h3>Libraries</h3>

<p>The following binding is exported by the <code>(srfi :260 generate-symbol)</code> library:</p>

<p><u>Procedure:</u> <code><b>generate-symbol</b></code> [<var>pretty-name</var>]

<p>The optional argument, <var>pretty-name</var>, must, if present, be a string.</p>

<p>Returns a symbol that is not identical to any existing or
potentially existing symbol, for all practical purposes.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> This means that for every Scheme
expression <code>&langle;expression&rangle;</code> whose (possibly
non-deterministic) value does not depend on the result
of <code>symbol-&gt;string</code> applied to the
result <var>gensym</var> of a previous invocation
of <code>generate-symbol</code>, its value is not equal (in the sense
of <code>equal?</code>) to the value
of <code>(symbol-&gt;string</code> <var>gensym</var><code>)</code> for
all practical purposes.</p>

<p>The implementation may use the argument <var>pretty-name</var> for debugging or pretty-printing purposes.</p>

<pre>(let ([s (generate-symbol)])
  (symbol=? s s)) ; => #t</pre>

<pre>(let ([s1 (generate-symbol)] [s2 (generate-symbol)])
  (symbol=? s1 s2)) ;=> #f</pre>

<pre>(let ([s1 (generate-symbol "g1")] [s2 (generate-symbol "g1")])
  (symbol=? s1 s2)) ;=> #f</pre>

<pre>(let ([s1 (generate-symbol "g1")] [s2 'g1])
  (symbol=? s1 s2)) ;=> #f</pre>

<pre>(let ([s (generate-symbol "g1")])
  (string=? (symbol-&gt;string s) "g1")) ;=> #f</pre>

<pre>(let ([s (generate-symbol)])
  (symbol=? (string-&gt;symbol (symbol-&gt;string s)) s)) ;=> #t</pre>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>A native implementation does not need to create a name for the
symbol returned by an application of <code>generate-symbol</code>
immediately but only lazily when <code>symbol-&gt;string</code> is
applied to the symbol for the first
time. If <code>symbol-&gt;string</code> is never applied as will likely
be the case in many uses of generated symbols, no name has to be
created. Symbols generated by <code>generate-symbol</code> can
therefore replace uninterned symbols known from some Scheme
implementations.</p>

<p>When an implementation has to create a name, it can simply choose a
randomly generated name so that the entropy of the random variable
described by <code>(lambda () (symbol-&gt;string (generate-symbol)))</code> is
sufficiently high (e.g. 122 bits as in the case of Version 4 UUIDs but
note that this SRFI prescribes no particular form of the symbol name).</p>

<p>The portable <a href="srfi/:260/generate-symbol.sls">sample
implementation</a> creates random names eagerly and
uses <code>/dev/random</code> for this purpose.</p>
